1st variant outputs:
Hello                                                            
Hello
2nd variant outputs:
Hello                                                            
/n                                                                 
/n

So, the difference between variants is in that:
In the first variant, both created processes have the same buffer, when parent process will make second printf, it will print all from the buffer
In the second variant, 
As child process inherits the buffer from the parent process, it will execute printf twice by child processes.
