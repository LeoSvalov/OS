(1). To increase Hit/Miss ratio, we can construct a sequence such that 
there will be requested mostly indentical(the same) page(s). Like, if 
it is sequence with request of the same page, we will get only 1 miss because initially we don't have any pages in memory. 
Example of sequence: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 
(2). To decrease Hit/Miss ratio, it's just opposite to (1).
If there are all different pages should be requested, Hit/Miss ratio will be 0, because there will not be any hits. 
Example of sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
